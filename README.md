# Bankrupcy-Prediction
The data were collected from the Taiwan Economic Journal for the years 1999 to 2009. Company bankruptcy was defined based on the business regulations of the Taiwan Stock Exchange. Our project is to explore the data for statistical reasonings and eventually train the data on a machine learning model which we can use to predict future companies stability.
